# Ship Shooter Backend Server Plan

This document outlines the tasks required to build a real-time backend server for Ship Shooter. The server will manage up to 10 concurrent games, each with up to 20 players, and support fast real-time updates, collision tracking, coin collection, and leaderboard management.

---

## 1. Server Architecture & Setup
- [ ] Choose technology stack (Node.js + Socket.IO recommended for real-time)
- [ ] Set up project structure and repository
- [ ] Configure environment variables and deployment settings

---

## 2. Game Session Management
- [ ] Create data model for games (max 10 concurrent)
- [ ] Implement game creation and destruction endpoints
- [ ] Track active games and their states
- [ ] Assign players to games and manage game lifecycle

---

## 3. Player Management
- [ ] Create player data model (position, score, coins, status)
- [ ] Handle player join/leave events
- [ ] Track player state in each game
- [ ] Manage player reconnection and disconnection

---

## 4. Real-Time Communication
- [ ] Integrate Socket.IO for real-time updates
- [ ] Broadcast player movements to all players in a game
- [ ] Optimize message frequency and payload for speed
- [ ] Handle latency and synchronization issues

---

## 5. Missile & Collision Handling
- [ ] Define missile data model and events
- [ ] Receive collision notifications from clients
- [ ] Validate collision events (anti-cheat)
- [ ] Update player health/status on hit
- [ ] Notify all players of hits and deaths

---

## 6. Coin Generation & Collection
- [ ] Generate coins for each player at game start
- [ ] Track coin positions and states
- [ ] Receive coin collection events from clients
- [ ] Validate and update coin collection
- [ ] Update player scores accordingly

---

## 7. Leaderboard & Scoring
- [ ] Track scores for all players in each game
- [ ] Update leaderboard in real-time
- [ ] Provide leaderboard data to clients
- [ ] Persist leaderboard data (optional)

---

## 8. API Endpoints (REST/Socket)
- [ ] Endpoint for joining/leaving games
- [ ] Endpoint for fetching game state
- [ ] Endpoint for leaderboard data
- [ ] Endpoint for player stats

---

## 9. Security & Validation
- [ ] Validate all client events (movement, collisions, coin collection)
- [ ] Prevent cheating and tampering
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and abuse prevention

---

## 10. Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [ ] Load test for real-time performance
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to production environment

---

## 11. Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints and socket events
- [ ] Write setup and deployment guides
- [ ] Create developer onboarding documentation

---

## 12. Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Set up server monitoring (CPU, memory, connections)
- [ ] Track game and player analytics
- [ ] Log errors and important events
